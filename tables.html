                      Supercomputers are the pinnacle, the peak, of computational
                      power, designed to handle extraordinarily complex and
                      resource-intensive tasks. These machines typically feature
                      thousands of processors working in parallel, enabling them to
                      perform trillions of calculations per second, far surpassing
                      the capabilities of personal computers or even most, if not
                      all/ server systems. The Sunway TaihuLight, a Chinese
                      supercomputer, housed at the National Supercomputing Center in
                      Wuxi, was the world’s fastest supercomputer from 2016 to 2018.
                      It delivers a peak performance of 125 petaflops, making it
                      125,000 times more powerful than top consumer-grade computers.
                      Powered by over 10 million cores, it was the first
                      supercomputer to exceed 100 petaflops without relying on
                      foreign chips. It also bears a clock speed of 1.45 GHz per
                      processor and an energy-efficient design consuming 15.37
                      megawatts.

                      of data need to be processed at incredibly high speeds. Sunway
                      TaihuLight was specifically used for weather forecasting,
                      oilfield analysis, and nuclear weapons design. It was also
                      used in Earth, ocean, and climate modeling and atomic
                      simulations, which allowed for breakthroughs in environmental
                      research, energy exploration, and scientific innovation.
                      Supercomputers are vital for advancing knowledge in physics,
                      medicine, and artificial intelligence by providing the raw

                    Mainframe computers are large, robust systems designed for
                    processing and managing vast amounts of data, primarily used by
                    large organizations due to their reliability, scalability, and
                    capacity to support thousands of users. They excel in executing
                    complex calculations and large-scale data analysis with minimal
                    downtime, making them ideal for high-speed processing
                    applications. The UNIVAC series, including the UNIVAC 9400,
                    represents some of the earliest general-purpose mainframes,
                    showcasing pioneering technical capabilities with notable
                    processing speeds and memory capacities.

                    Due to their strengths, mainframes are commonly used by IT
                    organizations to run critical applications. These applications
                    often involve customer order processing, financial transactions,
                    production, and inventory management. The UNIVAC systems, in
                    particular, were versatile and could handle multiple programs,
                    real-time processing, and data communications. They were widely
                    used for tasks like data storage, business transactions, and
                    scientific calculations because of their speed and support for
                    advanced peripherals like punched card readers and tape drives.

                      Mini computers are mid-sized systems designed to offer a
                      balance between performance and cost-effectiveness. They are
                      smaller and less expensive than mainframes but still capable
                      of handling multiple tasks and supporting multiple users
                      simultaneously. Despite their smaller size, minicomputers
                      provided powerful computing capabilities and contributed to
                      the normalization of access to computers. The Honeywell Level
                      6 is a classic example of an advanced mini-computer,
                      introduced in the mid-1970s. Initially designed with a 16-bit
                      architecture, it was later upgraded to a 32-bit system,
                      offering substantial performance improvements. These systems
                      supported up to 64 K words (KW) of MOS memory with a cycle
                      time of 650 nanoseconds.

        <h2>Analysis/Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          There is no doubt that computers, both their hardware and software,
          are amazing inventions. They can do things that people in medieval
          times would have thought were ‘magic’ or ‘sorcery.’ Many people don’t
          realize that a device allowing us to talk to someone across the globe
          can fit in our pockets—an idea that would have seemed silly or
          impossible in the 16th century. It’s incredible how quickly computing
          and technology have advanced in just a few decades. Computers are now
          everywhere. As shown in earlier slides, people in the past could not
          have imagined technology being used in medical practices to the extent
          it is today, since medicine is such a human-centered field. As a
          computer science student, I might be biased, but I think computers are
          among the greatest discoveries of humanity, alongside the first fire
          made by cavemen and Benjamin Franklin’s experiments with kites and
          electricity. It’s amazing that machines that once filled entire rooms
          to perform simple calculations can now fit on our desks. This progress
          is due to our ongoing efforts to improve hardware, which has greatly
          increased computing power. We even have a trend called Moore’s Law,
          which says that the number of transistors on a chip goes up while the
          price goes down every two years. I recently saw a video suggesting
          that the industry is reaching a point where this trend is starting to
          level off, but it’s still impressive that we have come this far and
          made powerful computers widely available. In summary, the development
          of computers is one of humanity's most significant achievements, much
          like discovering fire or electricity. As technology becomes part of
          every aspect of our lives, their future is full of possibilities, even
          as we face challenges in keeping up the rapid pace of change. The
          story of computing shows our endless curiosity and drive for
          innovation, constantly reshaping our world and society as we know it.

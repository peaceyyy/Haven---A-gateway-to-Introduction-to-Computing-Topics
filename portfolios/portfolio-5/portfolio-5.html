      <h2>Comparative Study on Different Types of Motherboards ○ Portfolio #5</h2>
    </div>

    <article class="article-container">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        A motherboard, also known as the main or system board, is the central
        component of a computer or electronic device that enables all parts to
        function together. It hosts the CPU, memory, storage, and various
        peripherals, acting as a hub for connectivity and communication between
        components. Motherboards vary in form factors, such as AT, ATX, LPX,
        BTX, and Mini ITX and each of them offers distinct features and is
        designed to suit different computer builds and needs depending on the
        user. This comparative study aims to clarify the types and
        characteristics of various motherboard models, highlighting the size and
        build, the number of slots they have, the chipsets they bear, and the
        built-in features they come with.

      <h2>Discussion</h2>

      <p>
        In examining the various types of motherboards, it becomes clear that
        each form factor is tailored to meet specific functional and physical
        requirements, reflecting the diversity of applications and needs in
        modern computing. From a more consumer-based perspective, it simply
        means that people have a variety of options to choose from, which
        obviously benefits the computer market. As an overview, motherboards
        like the ATX and Extended ATX (E-ATX) are designed for desktop setups
        that prioritize expandability and performance. These larger boards
        support multiple PCIe slots, additional memory slots, and advanced
        chipsets, making them suitable for high-performance workstations or
        gaming systems that benefit from upgrade flexibility and wider
        peripheral support. On the other hand, compact motherboard types such as
        Mini ITX and Pico BTX cater to space-constrained environments. In simple
        terms, they are meant to be space-saving and tend to prioritize
        efficient component placement and energy savings, making them ideal for
        compact desktops, embedded systems, and portable devices. However, these
        smaller boards usually have fewer slots and limited upgrade options,
        which can be a drawback for users who want high customizability.
        Overall, the form factor is an important factor in choosing a
        motherboard because it affects its physical size, layout complexity,
        power distribution, performance, and cooling. The summative table of
        motherboards above highlights the importance of aligning motherboard
        choice with the intended use and specific hardware requirements of a
        system which widely varies from user to user. Different motherboard
        types balance features, size, and compatibility, which affect a system’s
        performance, upgrade potential, and overall efficiency. By comparing
        these types, we, users, can better understand the reason and purpose
        behind each form factor, making ourselves aware of their respective
        strengths and weaknesses, leading to more informed decisions that
        enhance the performance and longevity of our computer systems.
